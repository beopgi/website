<h4><span class="badge badge-info">Abstract</span></h4>
<span class="badge badge-danger">Purpose</span>  The purpose of this study is to analyze the sentiment responses of the general public to non-face-to-face work using text mining methodology. As the number of non-face-to-face complaints is increasing over time, it is difficult to review and analyze in traditional methods such as surveys, and there is a limit to reflect real-time issues.


<span class="badge badge-danger">Approach</span> This study has proposed a method of the research model, first by collecting and cleansing the data related to non-face-to-face work among tweets posted on Twitter. Second, topics and keywords are extracted from tweets using LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation), a topic modeling technique, and changes for each section are analyzed through DTM(Dynamic Topic Modeling). Third, the complaints of non-face-to-face work are analyzed through the classification of positive and negative polarity in the COVID-19 section.


<span class="badge badge-danger">Findings</span> As a result of analyzing 1.54 million tweets related to non-face-to-face work, the number of IDs using non-face-to-face work-related words increased 7.2 times and the number of tweets increased 4.8 times after COVID-19. The top frequently used words related to non-face-to-face work appeared in the order of remote jobs, cybersecurity, technical jobs, productivity, and software. The words that have increased after the COVID-19 were concerned about lockdown and dismissal, and business transformation and also mentioned as to secure business continuity and virtual workplace. New Normal was newly mentioned as a new standard. Negative opinions found to be increased in the early stages of COVID-19 from 34% to 43%, and then stabilized again to 36% through non-face-to-face work sentiment analysis. The complaints were, policies such as strengthening cybersecurity, activating communication to improve work productivity, and diversifying work spaces.
