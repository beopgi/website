# Abstract

Fog computing is a promising paradigm in terms of extending cloud computing to an edge network. In a broad sense, fog computing in Internet-of-Vehicles(IoV) provides low-latency services since fog nodes are closely located with moving cars and are locally distributed. In this paper, we propose a fog computing architecture based on a publish/subscribe model. After that, we describe a traffic congestion control scenario using a smart traffic light system which operates on top of the proposed architecture. Furthermore, we propose an upper-level domain ontology in order to enhance the expressivity of knowledge and describe a variety of semantic properties which interlink spatial information in IoV. Finally, we present an active rule where supports the exchange of event-driven messages between publishing and subscribing fog nodes.
