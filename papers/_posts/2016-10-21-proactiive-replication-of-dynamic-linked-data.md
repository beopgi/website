# Abstract
In this paper, we propose a scalable method of proactively
replicating a subset of remote datasets for RDF Stream Processing. Our
solution achieves a fast query processing by maintaining the replicated
data up-to-date before query evaluation. To construct the replication
process effectively, we present an update estimation model to handle the
changes in updates over time. With the update estimation model, we
re-construct the replication process in response to the outdated data.
Finally, we conduct exhaustive tests with a real-world dataset to verify
our solution.
