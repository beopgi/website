# Abstract
The W3C RDF Stream Processing (RSP) community has proposed a
common model and a language for querying RDF streams. However, the current
RSP systems significantly differ from each other in terms of performance. In this
paper, we propose a unified interface for optimizing a continuous query in heterogeneous RSP systems. To enhance the performance of RSP, a unified interface
decomposes a query, reassembles partial queries and assigns them to appropriate
RSP systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs
better in terms of memory consumption and latency.
