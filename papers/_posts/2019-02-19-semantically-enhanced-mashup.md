<h4><span class="badge badge-info">Abstract</span></h4>
The accurate prediction of stress in a personâ€™s life has a significant effect on improving personal health and the national economy. Since individuals have different historical circumstances and personality traits, stress symptoms and levels may vary from person to person. Thus, most studies on stress prediction pay attention to personalized models, which determine the personal stress level using user-specific information and heterogeneous stress-related data. However, these models cannot elaborately handle the uncertainty caused by the sparsity, data imbalance, irregularity, and high-dimensionality of user-specific information. In particular, out-of-sample users increase uncertainty. To cope with the problem, we propose a personalized stress-level prediction model with inductive Gaussian representation (PSP-IGR), which exploits heterogeneous inputs with a unified end-to-end approach. PSP-IGR extracts feature vectors from the heterogeneous inputs via Gaussian sampling, domain rules, and deep learning, depending on the characteristics of each input. Especially, PSP-IGR inductively generates a Gaussian feature vector called IGR by Gaussian sampling from the shared contents of user-specific information. Thus, PSP-IGR not only generalizes to both in-sample and out-of-sample users effectively but also deals with the uncertainty problem caused by limitations of healthcare datasets. Also, since we fuse the extracted feature vectors considering their characteristics (Gaussian and point vectors), we can preserve the expressiveness of each feature vector. Experiments on a real-world dataset, including survey results, wearable sensor signals, and contexts, demonstrate that PSP-IGR shows higher accuracy in predicting individual stress-level than previous models.
