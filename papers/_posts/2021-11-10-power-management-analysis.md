## Abstract
This paper gives a design concept of a power management analysis and suggestion service platform for smart consumers. This platform provides historic and forecasting data of power consumption, electric rates, CO2 emission, and green points to consumers. The platform consists of several modules including power pattern analysis, power pattern forecasting, electric rate comparison and recommendation, power to green point conversion, and load scheduling for the reduction of power consumption and CO2 emission.
