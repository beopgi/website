## Research groups

### Knowledge evolution group

The goal of our research is to combine artificial intelligence, the semantic web, and (stream-)database integration techniques to solve complex, fast-changing information integration problems. We leverage general research techniques across information-intensive disciplines, including smart energy, data integration and the social web.

We are pursuing a novel approach to blend Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning(AI/ML) with knowledge stream processing. Our work focuses on solving real-world problems over Knowledge Graph to bridge various kinds of promising applications, such as the real-time bibliographic databases, social media applications, energy management, urban planning, and so on

* Deep Inferences over Evolving Knowledge Graph
  - Knowledge graph embeddings
  - Graph neural networks
  - Self-supervised learning

* Incremental Reasoning for Evolving Knowledge Graph
  - Measuring impacts of changes
  - Optimization, and evaluation of stream reasoners
  - Knowledge-based spatial-temporal graphs
  - (Approximate) Stream reasoning

* Cutting-Edge Applications based on Evolving Knowledge Graph
  - Smart city applications, Urban planning, Digital twins
  - Smart-grid/Micro-grid, Energy management systems, Open electric vehicle charging applications
  - Real-time systems for monitoring air pollution, e.g., TMS(Tele-Monitoring Systems)
  - Knowledge tracing, Scholarly knowledge graph, bibliographic database
  - Comparison and contrast of Massive online courses(or Massive online lectures)
  - and etc.

* Theoretical Foundation for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning(KR&R)
  - Graph-based models such as RDF/RDFS, Ontology, and Labeled Property Graph(LPG)
  - Logics such as  Description Logic, Description Logic, Metric Temporal Logic, and other logics
  - Graph Query Languages such as Gremlin, Cypher, SPARQL
  - Theoretical investigation that surpasses Complex Event Processing(CEP) and Data Stream Management(DSMS)
  - Notions of knowledge stream reasoning
