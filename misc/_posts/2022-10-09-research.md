## The goal of our research

This website designed as an open science showcase for recent work from the Bedford Lab.  We have a [blog](/blog/) for news and smaller analyses, but also [project pages](/projects/) that mirror ongoing research developments that take place on [GitHub](https://github.com/blab).  This structure is meant to make sharing of results as frictionless as possible, with the idea of having a GitHub repo that contains everything of key importance to a project.  Within this GitHub repo, `README.md` files or other Markdown files describe methods and results and such files get copied over to [projects/](/projects/), where we've attempted to streamline navigation.  So, reading the basics of a project can be done from the site, but if someone wants to really dive in, all the source code, data files, etc... are available from GitHub.

## Research Group

### Recommendation system group

### Knowledge evolution group

The goal of our research is to combine artificial intelligence, the semantic web, and (stream-)database integration techniques to solve complex, fast-changing information integration problems. We leverage general research techniques across information-intensive disciplines, including smart energy, data integration and the social web.

We are pursuing a novel approach to blend Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning(AI/ML) with knowledge stream processing. Our work focuses on solving real-world problems over Knowledge Graph to bridge various kinds of promising applications, such as the real-time bibliographic databases, social media applications, energy management, urban planning, and so on
